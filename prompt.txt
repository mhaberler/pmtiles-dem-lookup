the primary task is:

- create a typescript module called DEMLookup
- init parameter is a URL pointing to a pmtiles protomap
- use https://www.npmjs.com/package/pmtiles
- the protomap has mapbox rgb-encoded elevation data
- the module should be able to cache tiles
- there are sample pmtiles dems available at: https://static.mah.priv.at/cors/AT-10m-png.pmtiles and https://static.mah.priv.at/cors/AT-10m-webp.pmtiles
- when opening a pmtiles url, inspect zoom factors and use the highest one available

- the API shall be able to:
-- given lat and lon, return the elevation and meters/pixel resolution
-- cache a configurable number of tiles already retrieved
-- return info about the pmtiles file, namely resolution in meters/pixel, zoom factors, encoding/compression etc
-- a method to optionall pre-cache a tile and a bounding box of tiles
-- a method to clear the tile cache
-- have a debug flag to trace pmtiles steps (if available in protomaps)

the initial stage should be a nodejs test harness

lateron this shall be integrated into a vue demo app (I will tell you when)

the vue demo app shall have:
- a text region with parameter input and status display
- a leaflet window below, defaulting to track the current position - use  protomaps-leaflet for this
- moving the cursor over the map should cause a lookup to happen


-----

it seems this is still simulated elevation - is the decompression working?

----
add a test location called 'Stiwoll Kehrer' at 47.12871160312656, 15.210914658403269 , expected altitude around 860m


---

now add webp decompression and test with the webp compressed  pmtiles dem

------

now lets turn to the vue demo

use the existing tab src/views/Tab1Page.vue for para protomaps-leaflet meter input  (which of the two dems should be used) and app output as per below
below that add a leaflet map based on  protomaps-leaflet 
when you click on the map, show the elevation and related debug text in a region in the above text window
also display number of cached tiles
add a method to draw a bounding box and precache those dem tiles


-----

    map zoom and scroll is fine
    click - which should cause a dem lookup - does not work


the lookup works fine
console log:

the resulting value is just not displayed in the text part of the window - add that


its all there, just scroll...
